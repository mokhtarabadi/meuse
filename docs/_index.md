# Meuse, a free private Rust Registry

Meuse is a registry implementation for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

It implements the [alternative registries](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2141-alternative-registries.md) RFC and [API](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/registries.html), and also exposes an API to manage users, crates, tokens and categories. Meuse can store the crates binary files in various backends (filesystem, S3...).

It can also be used as a mirror for `crates.io`.

The project is open source, and the code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcorbin/meuse)
