# Meuse Setup - Work in Progress

## Current Status

We've made significant progress in setting up Meuse with Docker Compose. Here's the current status:

### Completed Tasks

1. **Environment Initialization**
    - Created initialization script `scripts/init-docker-env.sh` to set up required directories and files
    - Script successfully creates Git repository structure and configuration
    - Generated htpasswd file for Git HTTP authentication

2. **Docker Compose Configuration**
    - Created comprehensive Docker Compose setup with three services:
        - PostgreSQL database (working)
        - Git HTTP server (working)
        - Meuse application (having configuration issues)
    - Added health checks for all services
    - Added volume mounts for persistence
    - Implemented environment variable support

3. **Configuration Files**
    - Created `config/docker-config.yaml` with environment variable support
    - Updated `.env.example` with all required environment variables
    - Added comprehensive documentation

### Current Issues

The Meuse application container is having issues starting up, primarily related to configuration loading:

1. **Configuration Loading**
    - The application cannot load the configuration file from `/app/config/config.yaml`
    - Initial error: `NullPointerException: Cannot invoke "java.io.File.exists()" because "file" is null`
    - Added an entrypoint script to ensure the config directory exists

2. **Environment Variables**
    - Need to verify that all required environment variables are properly set and loaded

### Next Steps

1. **Fix Meuse Configuration**
    - Debug why the configuration file isn't being loaded properly
    - Check if environment variables are being properly substituted
    - Possibly modify the Docker image or configuration file

2. **Complete End-to-End Testing**
    - Once Meuse is running, test the complete workflow:
        - Creating an admin token
        - Creating a crate
        - Publishing the crate
        - Consuming the crate from another project

3. **Production Setup Guide**
    - Add TLS/HTTPS configuration
    - Document backup and restore procedures
    - Add monitoring recommendations

## Running the Current Setup

```bash
# Initialize the environment
./scripts/init-docker-env.sh

# Start the services
docker compose up -d

# Check the status
docker compose ps

# Check logs for Meuse
docker compose logs meuse
```

## Technical Details to Investigate

1. The Meuse container may need additional environment variables or configuration.
2. The Docker volume mounting for the configuration file needs verification.
3. The Docker entrypoint may need to be adjusted to properly initialize the application.
